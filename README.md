# Post it Not Django Project
 
Post it Not Application: This practical application helps you organize your daily life. You can record your tasks, reminders, and important information. The application has a simple interface and is easy to use. You can quickly take notes and categorize them. This way, you can store important information you don't want to forget and efficiently track your daily tasks.


In the front-end part of this site, I used bootstrap and ready-made templates by modifying them according to my own use. But I made the back-end part myself.
